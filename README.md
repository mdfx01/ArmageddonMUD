# ArmageddonMUD

## ArmMobile.tin
Follow the instructions https://tintin.mudhalla.net/install.php#iOS

Then, after that, return to the home directory and download the script below by:

* cd ~
* wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdfx01/ArmageddonMUD/main/ArmMobile.tin

Then run the script with:

* tt++ ArmMobile.tin

The commands are the same as the Mushclient infobar to make it work properly.  Run:
 - InstallInfobar
 - ManaOn  (will turn mana on in your prompt)
 - ManaOff (Default, will turn mana off in your prompt)

To quit out of tintin++, use #end

The script itself is very basic, there are only two highlights for stuff in the prompt.  Lots of customisation can be done.
